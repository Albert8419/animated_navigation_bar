# Animated Navigation Bar
This project is a modern, animated navigation bar that highlights user-selected items. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a visually appealing and interactive navigation experience.

Features:
Animated Indicator: A circular indicator moves smoothly beneath each icon as you navigate through the different items.
Icon and Text Animation: When an icon is clicked, it is animated, moving upwards, while the associated text fades in and rises from below.
Active State: The currently selected menu item is highlighted with a green indicator, and the text is displayed prominently.
Responsive and Interactive: Uses JavaScript to detect clicks on the navigation items and applies appropriate styles to visually highlight the active selection.
Navigation Items:
Home
Profile
Messages
Photos
Settings
Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the navigation menu and items.
CSS: For styling and adding smooth transitions, animations, and positioning.
JavaScript: For managing the active state, enabling interaction, and adding dynamic transitions.
How It Works:
HTML Structure: A <div> contains a list of navigation items, each containing an icon and a label.
CSS Styling: CSS handles the layout, animation, and transitions of the icons and text. When an item is clicked, the text becomes visible and the icon animates upwards.
JavaScript Interaction: The script listens for clicks on any of the navigation items. When clicked, it applies the active class to the selected item, triggering the associated CSS animations.
How to Use:
Clone or download the repository.
Open the index.html file in any browser to view the animated navigation bar.
Click on the navigation icons to see the smooth transition effects.
Feel free to modify the icons, text, or animations to suit your needs!
